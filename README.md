_The Universal Variable API is a global event emitter used to pass underlying page or view information to third party scripts._

Methodology
===========

Historically, a global variable named `window.universal_variable` was used for exposing web page or view information to third party scripts however this state based model was too basic and did not fit well with applications that did not do a full page reload.

Using the UV API all data is exposed as events using `window.uv`. All events conform to schemas defined in the QProtocol schemas.

Setting up and using the UV API
===============================

The UV API should be included as an inline script on the webpage at the top of head, immediately after the `<meta charset... />` tag. By embedding the API in the head synchronously, any script in the page is able to emit or handle events without polling or waiting for asynchronous scripts to load.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
(function(){function g(c,a){var d=a||{},e={},b;for(b in d)d.hasOwnProperty(b)&&(e[b]=d[b]);a=e;a.meta=a.meta||{};
a.meta.type=c;window.qubit.events.push(a)}function h(c,a){for(var d=c.length,e=[],b=0;b<d;b++)a(c[b])&&e.push(c[b]);
return e}window.qubit=window.qubit||{};window.qubit.emit=window.qubit.emit||g;window.qubit.events=window.qubit.events||[];
window.qubit.listeners=window.qubit.listeners||[];window.qubit.onReady=function(c){window.qubit.listeners.push(c);
return function(a){window.qubit.listeners=h(window.qubit.listeners,function(a){return a!==c})}};
var f=document.createElement("script");f.src="https://static.goqubit.com/smartserve-2499.js";
document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(f)})();
</script>
```

Compatibility
=============

Tested in IE8+, Firefox, Opera, Chrome and Safari.

API

### Emit

`uv.emit(type, [data])`

Emits an event with the __type__ and __data__ specified. The __data__ should conform to the schema for the event __type__ emitted. All events that are emitted are given a `meta` property with the event `type`.

```js
uv.emit('ecProduct', {
  product: {
    id: '112-334-a',
    price: 6.99,
    name: '18th Birthday Baloon',
    category: ['Party Accessories', 'Birthday Parties']
  },
  color: 'red',
  stock: 6,
  eventType: 'detail'
})
// => emits an ecProduct event
```

The emitted event will have meta attached.

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "type": "ecProduct"
  },
  "product": {
    "id": "112-334-a",
    "price": 6.99,
    "name": "18th Birthday Baloon",
    "category": ["Party Accessories", "Birthday Parties"]
  },
  "color": "red",
  "stock": 6,
  "eventType": "detail"
}
```


### On

`uv.on(type, handler, [context])`

Attaches an event __handler__ to be called when a certain event __type__ is emitted. The __handler__ will be passed the event data and will be bound to the __context__ object, if one is passed. If a regex is passed, the handler will execute on events that match the regex.

```js
uv.on('ecProduct', function (data) {
  console.log(data)
})
// => logs data when an `ecProduct` event is emitted

var subscription = uv.on(/.*/, function (data) {
  console.log(data)
})
// => logs data for all events
```

The on method returns a subscription object which can detatch the handler using the dispose method and can also be used to replay events currently in the event array. Note that subscription that have been disposed will not call the handler when replay is called.

```js
subscription.dispose()
// => detatches the event handler

subscription.replay()
// => calls the handler for all events currently in uv.events
```


### Once

`uv.once(type, handler, [context])`

Attaches an event __handler__ that will be called once, only on the next event emitted that matches the __type__ specified. The __handler__ will be passed the event data and will be bound to the context object, if one is passed. Returns a subscription object which can detatch the __handler__ using the dispose method. If a regex is passed, the handler will execute on the next event to match the regex.


```js
uv.once('ecProduct', function (data) {
  console.log(data)
})
emit('ecProduct')
// => logs data

emit('ecProduct')
// => does not log
```

### Events

The events array is a cache of events emitted since the last page load. By iterating over the array it is possible to interpret the user journey or the current state of the page.

### NPM module

The uv-api is available on the NPM registry.

```bash
npm i uv-api --save
```

The module exports a createUv function if required using commonjs.

```js
var createUv = require('uv-api')
var uv = createUv()
uv.emit('ecView')
```
